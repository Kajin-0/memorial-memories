<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 2025</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Memorial Memories™, a service operated by BrooksInvest LLC ("we", "our", or "us"). By placing an order, submitting content, or using our site, you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>Service Description</h2>
<p>Memorial Memories™ provides custom tribute videos generated using AI-based software. Users submit a photo and other requested materials through a form or email, and we return a digitally generated "living memory" video based on the input.</p>

<h2>Ownership & Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You retain ownership of the original photo and personal content you submit.</li>
  <li>By submitting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use that content solely for the purpose of producing your video.</li>
  <li>We do not use or distribute your video publicly unless you provide written permission (e.g. a testimonial or share request).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of AI Tools</h2>
<p>We use third-party AI services (such as Kling AI and online editing tools) to generate tribute videos. These services may have their own usage policies, which we follow. While we strive for high accuracy, AI outputs are not guaranteed to be error-free or exact likenesses.</p>

<h2>Consent & Responsibility</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You affirm you have permission to submit content on behalf of the individual depicted (if applicable).</li>
  <li>You agree not to upload offensive, illegal, or copyrighted material without authorization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Refunds & Revisions</h2>
<p>All sales are final due to the digital and custom nature of the product. However, if the video is not satisfactory, you may request one revision at no additional cost. We aim to deliver a meaningful and respectful final result.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Memorial Memories™ provides videos "as-is" and does not guarantee exact likeness or emotional suitability.</li>
  <li>We are not liable for indirect or emotional damages resulting from interpretation or expectations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information. By using our service, you agree to that policy.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to decline or cancel orders that violate our content standards or terms.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, USA. Any disputes shall be resolved in the appropriate courts of Florida.</p>
